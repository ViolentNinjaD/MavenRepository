MavenRepoistory
===============

This will allow me to use Maven things for my projects :)

Maven allows you to write a few things into build.gradle and have Gradle automatically download amy dependencies you need from their respective Mavem Repositories. Generally, people use their own websites to host a Maven Repository; but since I don't have a domain name I can't really do that :( So I host mine on GitHub.
